/**
 * `window.game`: the game, for tests and for poking at from the console.
 * Everything a test needs to set a scene, play it exactly and read back
 * what happened, so no test waits on a clock or reaches into the game's
 * insides.
 *
 * Time is the test's to keep: `pause` stops the game where it is, and
 * `step` plays it on a frame at a time, exactly, drawing the last. `seed`
 * makes chance repeat. While the floor is empty that is all there is to
 * it; each thing put on it gains here what a test needs to place it and
 * read it back.
 *
 * The types are shared with the smoke tests, so a test that calls something
 * that is not here does not compile.
