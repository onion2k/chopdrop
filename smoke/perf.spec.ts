/**
 * What the game costs a player, held to a budget and to what it cost
 * before: how long it takes to boot, what a frame costs to draw at the
 * standard view, and how much is downloaded. The budget is what a good
 * browser game may cost at all; the baseline is what this one cost at the
 * last commit, so a step toward the budget is noticed as much as a step
 * over it.
 *
 *   npm run perf               the figures, held to smoke/perf-baseline.json and the budget
 *   npm run perf:update        the baseline written again, after a change meant to move it
 *
 * The boot and the frame are this machine's, headless on its own GPU, and
 * both wobble from run to run; the tolerances were set by running it several
 * times first, and the frame is the least of many samples. The download is
 * the built bundle, gzipped, and does not wobble at all, so it is held to the
 * byte. How each is judged is in `judging.ts`, with its tests.
